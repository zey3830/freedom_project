# Freedom Project

Welcome to my freedom project. You might wonder what a freedom project is right? Well, in short it's just a project that require us to research about a topic and create a website related to it.

This page you are on now right now is the start of my website about my freedom topic of stocks and the stock market.

There really isn't much to say, so move on to the site through [this](https://zey3830.github.io/freedom_project/).

This will be the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vC52S0OhWrqQwptcZ7bCjr4qgKO40Npk_AQYTxTjRfs/edit?usp=sharing).

And this will be the [blog entries](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GnpqguY71Eby_Z74gz-KGmwGvnnpvS4E4aOXlrW_cjw/edit?usp=sharing).
